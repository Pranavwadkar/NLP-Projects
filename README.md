Text summarization is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset that represents the most 
important or relevant information within the original content. In addition to text.


##There are mainly two types of text summarization techniques


1. Extractive Text summarization
Def - Extractive summarization aims at identifying the salient information that is then extracted and grouped together to form a concise summary. 

Algorithms - Google BERT ,LSA, GPT ,GPT-3

3. Abstractive Text summarization
Def- An abstractive summarization method is generating the meaningful summary without copying the contents of the input text but to present the relevent
summary in the form of new and relevent information

## Steps for implementation of extractive text summarization-
1. Text cleaning
2. Sentence tokenization
3. Word frequency table
4. Clustering
5. Generating the summary by calcularting the score of each tokensised sentence.

One of the important libraries used in the domain of Natural language processing is NLTK(ie. Natural language Toolkit)

NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for 
classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61554733/202658822-8ecc1c14-e2f5-4dd3-b3c6-50bc4f589d12.png)




Text summarization using Word2vec is a unique kind of text summarization which uses the pre-trained word embeddings to process the input para and generating 
summary for the same.
